helsinki-address-register
=========================

Helsinki address register contains Helsinki address data from http://kartta.hel.fi/avoindata/. The data origin is address data 21.3.2013 and downloaded from http://kartta.hel.fi/avoindata/aineistot/Helsingin_osoiteluettelo.zip.

After that every change is correction to the origin data.

Note, this is experimentation and this is not official Helsinki GitHub account or data repository.
